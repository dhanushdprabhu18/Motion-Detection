Motion Detection system using open cv

# Motion Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates a basic motion detection system using OpenCV and Python. It captures video from a camera, processes the frames to detect moving objects, and highlights the detected motion areas in real-time.

## Features

- Capture video feed from the webcam.
- Convert frames to grayscale and apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction.
- Detect motion by comparing the current frame with the first frame.
- Highlight moving objects with bounding rectangles.
- Display status text indicating whether motion is detected.
- Press 'q' to quit the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Imutils
- Time module (standard Python library)

## Installation

Install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils
